# notes

These are a collection of notes that I keep for my own personal work. It contains
- Code snippets
- Conceptual things that I write up when working through a problem
- References to commonly used papers, data, or resources
- Some book notes for review later
- Things I write up for some of my students

Hoping that others might find some of it useful.
