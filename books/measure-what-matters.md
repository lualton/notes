*Notes from Measure What Matters by John Doerr*

Quick summary: It's a book about a goal-setting paradigm that many top organizations use.

** OKR - Objectives and Key Results **

Objectives - What we want to achieve

Key Results - How the objectives will be reached with specific measurable actions within a set time frame..

** Objectives **

Objectives are what we want to achieve. They should be significant, concrete, action-oriented, AND inspirational. Objectives should serve as defense against fuzzy thinking and fuzzy execution.

** Key Results **

Key Results benchmark and monitor how we get to the objective. These are specific and time bound, agressive and realistic. And they need to be measurable and verifiable.

Key Results are either met or not. There should be no gray area about it. They remove ambiguity about progress.

** The value of OKR is in reflection **

After the end of an OKR period (achieved or not), reflect on what went well or what didn't go well. Some questions to ask:

1. Did I accomplish all my objectives? And what contributed to my success?
2. What obstacles did I encounter?
3. If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change?
4. What I have learned that might alter my approach in the next cycle?

** Be Realistic **

Goals and objectives should be aspirational, but you damage credibility if you set it too high.


** Ideas aren't good enough **

Ideas are fine. Execution is everything.


** Examples **

|Objective: I want to become a proficient player in volleyball in one year|
| --- |
|1. I attend practice twice a week for a year (allowing deviations for holidays) |
|2. I enter three official tournaments in the year|
|3. I run three miles a week|


|Objective: Global eradication of malaria by 2040|
| --- |
|1. Prove to the world that a radical cure-based approach can lead to regional elimination |
|2. Prepare for scale-up by creating the necessary tools - SERCAP (Single Exposure Radical Cure and Prophylaxis)|
|3. Sustain current global progress to ensure the environment is conducive to eradication push.|
