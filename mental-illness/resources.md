#### The Depresjon Dataset
https://datasets.simula.no//depresjon/

The dataset was originally collected for the study of motor activity in schizophrenia and major depression. Motor activity was monitored with an actigraph watch worn at the right wrist. The actigraph watch measures activity levels. The sampling frequency is 32Hz and movements over 0.05 g are recorded. A corresponding voltage is produced and is stored as an activity count in the memory unit of the actigraph watch. The number of counts is proportional to the intensity of the movement. Total activity counts were continuously recorded in one minute intervals.
