*Notes from The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo*


**Categories, not rooms**

It's easier to clean based on categories such as clothes or books instead of by room. It keeps your mind focused on similar items instead of having to process how you feel things of different purposes.


**Thank your things before you throw them out**

Easier for people who get attached to things. Thanking an item for its service to your life can help in finally getting rid of it. 


**Useful or sparking joy**

Keep things that have a use or things that bring you happiness. It should be quick. If you have to analyze whether something brings you joy, it typically doesn't.

The same idea should be applied to buying things. If you try on a new pair of pants and go "I'll buy and return it if I end up not liking it", just don't buy it. 


**Choose what to keep, not what to discard**

This is a much harder task, but also much simpler. IF you know what kind of lifestyle you want, you can keep items that fit into that ideal. Otherwise, having to consider discarding every item can get tiring. The default is "Throw everything out." The question is now "Except what should I keep?"


**Things have a monetary cost, storage cost, and mental cost**

You buy something, you already paid. That money is not coming back. But that's not a good reason to keep things. By keeping it, you will continually have a storage cost because space in your house is not free. You're paying for all the space. Similarly, by seeing it and considering it, it takes up some mental cost.

If you have trouble parting with something old, consider the storage and mental cost of it as well. 


**Dealing with old papers**

You only need two piles of papers in your house. Papers that should be saved (birth certificate, marriage stuff) or papers that need to be managed now (paying bills). 


**Mementos**

This is the hardest one. These are things that you never think about until you consider throwing them away. Any box that you keep at home for "memory" is usually never opened again. Get rid of it. 


**Declutter first, and then store**

It's impossible to store your way out of clutter. Get rid of things and then consider how to properly store the rest.
