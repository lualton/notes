### Asthma

Condition where airways narrow, swell, and produce extra mucus. This makes breathing difficult, which causes coughing, wheezing, and short breath.

There are gradients of asthma, from being a minor problem to a major issues that interferes with life and cause death.

There is no cure, but symptoms can be controlled.

Symptoms
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness or pain
- Trouble sleeping caused by other symptoms
- Whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling
- Symptoms worsen with cold or flu

Signs of worsening:
- More frequent symptoms and more intense
- Increased difficulty breathing
- Needing to use an inhaler more often

Situational Asthma:
- During exercise, especially in cold or dry air
- Workplace, such as chemicals, gas, or other pollutants
- Allergy-induced, from pollen, mold, pets, etc.

### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)

Inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow. Caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or pollutants. Cigarette smoke is a common cause. Higher risk of developing heart disease, lung cancer, etc.

Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are two most common conditions contributing.

Chronic bronchitis: inflammation of the lining of bronchial tubes, which carry air to alveoli (air sac in lungs). Daily cough and mucus production.

Emphysema: Alveoli of lungs are destroyed due to irritants.
