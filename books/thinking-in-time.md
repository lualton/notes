*Notes on Thinking in Time by Richard E. Neustadt and Ernest R. May*

**Quick Summary**

This is a book about how to use history as a tool for decision-making, geared towards people in office. However, this can still be useful for any type of meaningful decision. History can be extremely valuable as decision-tool, but can lead people to incorrect assumption. A key quote: "History repeats itself, but always gets the details wrong."


**Focus on the situation, not the action**

Frequently, whenever a decision comes up, people ask "What should we do?" This often leads to rash, unanalyzed options. Try to assess the situation first.

* **Journalist Questions**: Who, what, when, where, why? Figure these out and it will allow you to more accurately determine a course of action.
* **Known, Unclear, Assumptions**: Figure out what you know. Figure out what is unclear in the situation. And figure out what you are currently assuming about the situation.


**Using a framework to consider history's relevance to a particular problem.**

For every comparison to some event in history, figure out the following. 
* What are the similarities?
* What are the differences?
* What assumptions are we making?


**The Goldberg Rule**

Figure out the story first. What are you concerned about and how did these particular concerns develop?


**Timelines**

Start the story as far back as possible and take into account key trends. Doing so provides context to the situation and leads to good analysis.
