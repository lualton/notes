*Notes about Everybody Lies by Seth Stephens-Davidowitz*

Great writer. Simple and engaging style. Questionable science.

Two critiques and two good things.

***Everything seems to be 'surprising and counterintuitive'***

People often associate 'surprising results' to mean more trust-worthy results. But people wouldn't talk about results that are unsurprising. This tends to be the approach Stephens-Davidowitz uses for every single example.

Stephens wrote of finding these counterintuitive results with basketball players. He argued that most people would think that NBA-level players would come from low-income communities because 'it builds a drive to succeed' that you wouldn't get in a suburban basketball kid. He then goes on to explain three studies that proved basketball players are more likely to come from wealthy neighborhoods. 

There's no reason that anyone in 2017 would find this surprising.

There has been an enormous wealth of research about how income/zip code impacts life-long outcomes. A google scholar search of "socioeconomic factors" brings up research from 1998 about the effects of income on health. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=socioeconomic+factors+&btnG=. Another search with socioeconomic factors and The Olympics show research from the 1970's. 

This is just one example where Stephens tries to use the 'surprising' angel to convince readers, but it falls short when there are big misses like this. In regards to basketball and NBA attainment, the intuitive answer would actually be that families with money can afford to put their kids through training camps, on travel teams, and otherwise fund their sports endeavors. 

He's a Harvard-trained economist, so he definitely knows about the bulk of studies around childhood socioeconomic factors. 


***Data Science is simple and intuitive***

Stephens makes a claim that data science should be simple and intuitive. Which I don't agree with. 

I believe that data science findings should be simple. But the process definitely is not. Data science should operate like a science. Meaning there's a scientific method that should be applied. We need to follow specific procedures such as hypothesis, creating a prediction, etc.

Most of what Stephens presents is what I would call correlation statistics. Like the basketball players coming from wealthier areas - that is a fact shown by simple data exploration. Or that certain areas of the United States google more racist queries than others. Or males most often Google questions about their penis size. 

These are definitely interesting things to know. But it's like fun-facts. Or pop science. His examples about how race affected the 2012 election or treatment for depression is far more interesting and potentially *insightful*. But the bulk of the book does not cover in-depth these kinds of research. Rather, most of it is spent on pop fluff fun facts. 

***The Power of Data Exploration***

This book really demonstrates the power of data exploration. It's something my professor in big data kept trying to tell us. You can find valuable insight from just putting some numbers in a bar chart or getting some ratios based on some demographic grouping. 

Stephens's entire book is basically an exercise in data exploration with Google Trends data and it shows that you can find a lot of interesting stuff. His example of using a horse's organ size to determine winners is a key example of valuable insight. And this leads into another great thing about the book.

***The importance of creativity***

One of the struggles I have and many people I teach as well, is this creativity aspect of analytics. It's more harder to find a novel way to use data or even a novel dataset to acquire than it is to run descriptive or predictive analytics. 

I did research on predicting depression of social media users and thought I was extremely clever for understanding that those depressed people often post about being tired and not getting out of bed, rather than overt cues like "I'm depressed." Only once I looked deeper into the literature, many others have already done that.

Stephens is clearly a creative-thinking though and it shows in the kinds of questions he poses in the book.
