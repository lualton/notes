*Notes from Mind Fixers: Psychiatry's Troubled Search for the Biology of Mental Illness by Anne Harrington*


**Asylums**

Originally created to offer a humane form of incarceration, they became therapy in themselves. They provided structure of patients, as well as research grounds for psychiatrists.

** Similarities to today **

Quote from Dr. Pliny Earle in 1890: "All the known data very clearly lead to the inference that insanity [mental illness] in the United states is increasing, not merely absolutely in correspondence with the increases of population, but relatively as compared with the number of inhabitants."

Epidemiological explanation argues this relative increase was due to increases in cases of syphilis.

Different understanding took hold back then: "A simple claim that some people were unsuited to handle the pressures of modern life. The challenges of life in an advancing, fast-paced society did not spur them onward and upward but instead un-maksed their inadequacies, addled their nervous systems and derailed their minds."
