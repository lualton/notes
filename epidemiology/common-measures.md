# Common Measures & Statistics Used in Epidemiology

### Measures of Frequency
There are different ways to measure the occurrence of some health outcome. The three commonly used are called risk, rate, and prevalence.


#### Risk
Also known as incidence, cumulative incidence, incidence proportion, attack rate

**The probability that an unaffected person develops a specific health outcome over a period of time**

Risk = New Cases / Total Individuals at Risk

Examples:
- A 5 year risk of .1 means that someone has a 10% chance of developing the health outcome in a 5 year period
- A 1 year risk of .5 means that someone has a 50% chance of developing the outcome in a 1 year period

Other details:
- Risk is usually used in prospective studies (observational or larger) because the population at risk can be defined
- Case control studies cannot because the total at risk population isn't defined. In these situations, the odds are usually used.

Odds = Number with outcome / Number without outcome

#### Rate
Incidence Rate, Incidence Density

**How quickly a health outcome is occurring in a population**

Rate = New Cases / Total Person Time at Risk

Person-Time
- The sum of time that each at-risk person contributes to the study
- 1 Individual, 1-year = 1 Person-Year
- 5 Individuals, 3 years = 15 Person-Years

A Rate of .1 cases/person-year means that, on average, for every 10 person-years, 1 new case of the outcome will develop.

#### Prevalence

**Proportion of the population with the health outcome for a given period of time**

Prevalence is used when we don't know when a specific health outcome started. Asthma, obseity, arthritis are examples.

Prevalence = Number Affected / Total Number in the Population

Notes:
- Causality is a problem because exposure and outcome is difficult to calculate
- This favors chronic diseases over acute ones because of mortality of chronic issues.
- A prevalence of .25 means 25% of the population has that outcome.
