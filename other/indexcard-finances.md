**9 tips for personal finance**
* MAX your 401(k) or equivalent employee contribution.
* Buy inexpensive, well-diversified mutual funds such as Vanguard Target 20xx funds. 
* Never buy or sell an individual security. The person on the other side of the table knows more than you do about that stuff.
* Save 20% of your money. 
* Pay your credit card balance in full every month.
* Maximize tax-advantaged savings vehicles like ROTH, SEP, and 529 accounts.
* Pay attention to fees. Avoid actively managed funds.
* Make financial advisor commit to a fiduciary standard.
* Promote social insurance programs to help people when things go wrong.


**Notes and criticisms from other people about the advice**
1. Saving 20% of your money

A lot of people can't save 20%, especially with many living paycheck to paycheck. A key idea is to start saving whatever you can. 1% is better than 0%. 1 dollar is better than 0. 

2. Promoting social insurance

This isn't really perosnal finance, but can still be a good thing to consider. The idea behind unemployment insurance is to give people time to find another job. The principle of the policy is good, even if there is some abuse. That's probably the key idea behind this final advice.
