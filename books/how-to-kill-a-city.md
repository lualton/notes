*Notes from How to Kill a City by Peter Moskowitz*

**Quick Review**

This is a book about gentrification. Well-written book with a lot of emotional anecdotes. Appears well-researched (lot of sources, but I haven't personally checked them). His central argument: that gentrification is the result of policy, not individual actor's decisions, is compelling and convincing. His recommendations to solve the issue lack rigor and actual research. 


**Definition of Gentrification, according to Moskowitz**

Gentrification is about reorienting the purpose of cities away from spaces that provide for the poor and middle class and towards being spaces that generate capital for the rich. 


**Phases of Gentrification**
1. Individuals first begin moving into a previously poor neighborhood. These are pioneers and typically lead because of affordability, acceptance (historically these individuals were gay/lesbian). 
2. Additional people see this change happening and begin buying up real estate in the neighborhood. These are people who want a cultured living space or small-scale speculators trying to buy low and sell high.
3. Gentrifies take part in the community by joining neighborhood committees and advertising the area to outsiders. This is the stage with the most tension between the new and the old.
4. Professionals replace artists and punks. Properties are turned into high-cost condos and displacement is at a peak. Gentrification begins moving to nearby neighborhoods. 


**New Orleans and FEMA**

There is no federal mandate to return people to their homes after a disaster. Most of Hurricane Katrina's victims were placed anywhere in the United States. 


**Cities seeking economic growth as a result of federal defunding**

Sometime during the Reagan administration, there was a massive budget cut which results in cities losing money. In order to cover budgets, cities had to find other places for revenue. Poor people don't typically have money, so cities began changing policies in order to lure companies to the cities. This involved also marketing to younger, wealthier people in order to get tax revenues. 


**The poor subsidizing the rich**

Detroit had a huge issue with the financial crisis, which led to a lot of Detroit's financial problems. Among the abandoned houses on the outskirts of the city, we see a property tax bill of $4000 for a house that was bought for $10,000. The poor that typically buy these houses end up paying taxes for services they typically don't receive. These can be things like street lights, filling potholes, garbage pickup. 

Most investments in Detroit come from a group of wealth billionaires and nonprofit organizations. These investments are concentrated in the 7.2 miles around the downtown. This area has gotten investments in public transportations, government subsidies, and is shown in the media as a place of Detroit's revival as the entire rest of the city is wasting away. 

 
**Interesting Quote**

Moskowitz stated "Truly equitable geographies would be largely un-gentrifiable ones." I'm still trying to figure out what this would look like. Is it a mixed-neighborhood where housing values are equal, everywhere? 


**Spatial inequality**

The United States has always had a housing legacy against minority and low-income groups. It was a lot of FDR policies and redlining that set the stage for gentrification almost 80 years ago. "If black Americans had been able to achieve the same kind of success through housing that whites had, gentrification would not be such a race-based phenomenon.

Now, white people are being subsidized by the local, state, and federal governments to reinhabit cities while the low-income groups are pushed out.


**Policy recommendations**

There are a few policies that Moskowitz recommends.
	1. Prevent increasing value of land from displacing people (section 8 housing). 
	2. Find a way to give voice to the people. New York City uses community boards. And these boards should have some real power.
	3. Heavily regulate housing. This means rent control. 
	4. End protectionism, add infrastructure. Certain neighborhoods get all the development while others (usually full of high-income white families) do not. There should be equitable zoning across all neighborhoods.
	5. Increase government ownership of land and what they do on that land. This means that certain land can be used for community parks or public house. 


**Important quote**

From Jane Jacobs, author of The Death and Life of Great American Cities. "Private investment shapes cities, but social ideas (and laws) shape private investment. First comes the image of what we want, then the machinery is adapted to turn out that image."
