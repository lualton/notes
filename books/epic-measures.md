*Notes about Epic Measures by Jeremy N. Smith*


**Quick Summary**

Epic Measures is the story of Chris Murray, a Harvard trained doctor and economist and his goal to create better health measurement in the world. His work, while still continuing, most recently culminated in the creation of the Global Burden of Disease, a way of measuring health more holistically. The important aspect is this Global Burden measured death, but also measured disability and allowed policy makers fine-grained understanding of exactly what health problems their country has.


**Initial global health measurements were inaccurate due to politics**

Several departments at the WHO, the UN, among other international agencies, focus on tracking health. But there was a challenge involved. These separate departments would often double-count individual deaths. If they counted an individual who had died from malaria, but also had diarrhea, each department tracking these ailments would list this as a death under their specific category.   

This led to widely inaccurate measurements, but no departments wanted to collaborate. They had their own specialties and their own way of calculating. Furthermore, it was difficult to figure out exactly


**What's measured decides funding**

This is a common aspect in all business and policy. Murray described a time when his measurements showed that the death of women during childbirth drastically reduced over a five year period. But when he tried to get the WHO to change their estimates, advocacy groups lobbied against it. These groups believed if this progress was shown, they'd lose funding to continue the progress.


**Prioritization Kills**

Some health workers believe that prioritization kills. This means that if you make malaria the most important and put most of your funding and effort towards malaria prevention, something else like childbirth mortality would increase. Thus, by prioritizing malaria, you kill others.  

This is a ridiculous concept, as all decisions involve trade-offs. Funding for global health is not unlimited, so you have to make priorities. The question here is there needs to be an objective way of deciding what's more important in someone's health.


**The Burden of Disease**

- Years of Healthy Life Lost to Early Death (YLL)

Assume an average lifespan of 80 years. If an individual died to a stroke at the age of 70, then Stroke will have taken 10 years of healthy life. If someone died to Pneumonia at age 2, then Pneumonia will have taken 78 years of healthy life.

- Year of Healthy Life Lost to Disability (YLD)

This concerns non-fatal health concerns. The ingenuity of this measurement is that we care about healthy life. Thus, life lived with disability is not healthy life. However, it can still be a good life. Murray and his team went and collaborated with many health experts from many countries to determine how difficult it is to live with certain diseases.

For example, Severe Depression was given a weight of 0.6. This means that over a decade, having Severe Depression would take 6 years of healthy life out of the total 10 years. 

Deafness was given a weight of 0.2. This means that over a decade, having deafness would take 2 years of healthy life out of the total 10 years.

- **Burden = YLL + YLD**

This is a really elegant way of thinking about it because it allows extremely complex health issues to be simplified to a understanding of human lifetime. It also completely changed how countries could see their population health. 

The key is that the policy *should* care about the health of individuals as much as preventing people from dying. A large concentration of funding focused on keeping kids alive in the first years of their life. But then a few years later, these kids end up dying from some injury related accident. What was the point in keeping them alive if they just die 3 years later? 

The Global Burden of Disease allowed countries to see exactly what was killing their people and what was ailing their people on a constant scale. From there, they could determine where their priorities need to be. 


**Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)**

IHME was created to accomplish this Global Burden of Disease and funded by the Gates Foundation. It's connected to the University of Washington and continually updates the Burden measurements. Currently, the organization is trying to move from the country-level data they created in 2013 to smaller scales, such as city or counties. Doing so requires close collaboration with the specific countries.
